# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature implements an automated deployment workflow for the Astro portfolio website to Fly.io using GitHub Actions. The deployment should be triggered automatically on pushes to the main branch and provide a reliable, secure way to deploy the application to production.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the application to automatically deploy to Fly.io when I push changes to the main branch, so that I don't have to manually deploy every time I make updates.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN code is pushed to the main branch THEN the GitHub Actions workflow SHALL trigger automatically
2. WHEN the workflow runs THEN it SHALL build the Astro application successfully
3. WHEN the build is successful THEN it SHALL deploy the application to Fly.io
4. WHEN deployment completes THEN the application SHALL be accessible at the Fly.io URL

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the deployment process to be secure and use proper authentication, so that unauthorized users cannot deploy to my Fly.io application.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the workflow authenticates with Fly.io THEN it SHALL use secure API tokens stored as GitHub secrets
2. WHEN accessing sensitive configuration THEN the workflow SHALL NOT expose secrets in logs
3. WHEN deployment fails due to authentication THEN the workflow SHALL fail with a clear error message

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to see the status of deployments clearly, so that I can quickly identify if a deployment succeeded or failed.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a deployment starts THEN GitHub SHALL show the workflow status as "in progress"
2. WHEN a deployment succeeds THEN GitHub SHALL show the workflow status as "success" with a green checkmark
3. WHEN a deployment fails THEN GitHub SHALL show the workflow status as "failed" with detailed error logs
4. WHEN viewing the repository THEN I SHALL see the latest deployment status badge or indicator

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the deployment to handle both the build process and Fly.io configuration, so that the entire deployment is automated without manual intervention.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the workflow runs THEN it SHALL install all necessary dependencies
2. WHEN dependencies are installed THEN it SHALL build the Astro application for production
3. WHEN the build completes THEN it SHALL create or update the Fly.io application configuration
4. WHEN configuration is ready THEN it SHALL deploy the built application to Fly.io

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the deployment to be efficient and not waste resources, so that deployments complete quickly and don't consume unnecessary compute time.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the workflow runs THEN it SHALL use appropriate caching for dependencies
2. WHEN building the application THEN it SHALL only rebuild changed files when possible
3. WHEN deployment is complete THEN it SHALL clean up temporary resources
4. WHEN no changes affect the application THEN the workflow SHALL complete quickly

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to be able to configure deployment settings easily, so that I can customize the deployment process for different environments or requirements.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN setting up deployment THEN configuration SHALL be stored in version-controlled files
2. WHEN modifying deployment settings THEN changes SHALL be applied on the next deployment
3. WHEN environment-specific settings are needed THEN they SHALL be configurable through GitHub secrets or environment variables
4. IF deployment configuration is invalid THEN the workflow SHALL fail with descriptive error messages
