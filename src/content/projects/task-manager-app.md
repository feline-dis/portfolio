# Task Manager App

A comprehensive task management application that helps users organize their daily tasks and projects. Built with modern web technologies for optimal performance and user experience.

## Features

- **Task Creation & Management**: Create, edit, and delete tasks with due dates and priorities
- **Project Organization**: Group tasks into projects for better organization
- **Real-time Updates**: Live synchronization across multiple devices
- **User Authentication**: Secure login and user management
- **Responsive Design**: Works seamlessly on desktop and mobile devices

## Technical Implementation

The application follows a modern full-stack architecture:

- **Frontend**: React with TypeScript for type safety and better developer experience
- **Backend**: Node.js with Express for RESTful API endpoints
- **Database**: MongoDB for flexible document storage
- **Authentication**: JWT-based authentication system
- **Deployment**: Containerized with Docker for consistent deployment

## Key Challenges Solved

1. **Real-time Synchronization**: Implemented WebSocket connections for instant updates
2. **Performance Optimization**: Used React.memo and useMemo for efficient re-renders
3. **Data Validation**: Comprehensive input validation on both client and server
4. **Error Handling**: Graceful error handling with user-friendly messages

This project demonstrates proficiency in full-stack development, modern JavaScript frameworks, and database design.
